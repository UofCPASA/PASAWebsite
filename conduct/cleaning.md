When you leave the room, please make sure you check the tables and floors for your napkins, empty bottles, scrap paper, and so on. When we say "help keep PASA clean", we mean:
- **Messes:** There should be no garbage on the tables, including empty (or full) food containers, napkins, scrap paper, etc...
- **Floor:** The floor should be swept. We acknowledge that it's pretty difficult to keep the floor clean, so we're pretty lenient on this one; so long as it isn't too bad.
- **Spills:** If anything has been spilled on the tables, it needs to be cleaned up. This includes food/drink spills, chalk drawings, etc...
- **Cans/Bottles:** There should be NO bottles or cans left on any surface in PASA. Please place them in one of the recycling bins. If the cans still contain liquid, MAKE SURE you empty them into the water fountain outside PASA first.
- **Garbage/Recycling cans**: If these are full, they should be emptied. Extra bags can be found in Inspector Gadget.

Finally please try to recycle your pop cans inside PASA, so we can recover the money we spend on pop.
