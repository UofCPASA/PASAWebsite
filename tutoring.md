##### Due to a lack of available tutors, we will not be running this program this year. Feel free to drop by PASA during the late afternoons or early evenings if you have a question or two, or are looking for a place to study.

Tutoring occurs on a drop-in basis; to get help with a particular subject, simply show up at any time during the session and we will match you with a tutor who can offer you assistance. You are also welcome to use the room to work on your homework individually, only utilizing a tutor's expertise when you have a question.

Tutors are upper-year physics students who have demonstrated their skill in a particular subject area: tutors are only PASA-approved to tutor a course if they have obtained a B+ or higher in that or an equivalent course, or if the tutor has been a TA or LA for the course.
