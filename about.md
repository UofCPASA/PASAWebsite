The most reliable way to talk to us is to stop by and hang out. We're a fairly social club and provide our members with a place to go have fun during their breaks. That being said, we also provide some academic resources, such as a study space taking up half of the room, a physics library and a collection of old assignments and exams.

If you have a PASA membership, you should also be receiving sporadic emails regarding events, peer tutoring, and other physics/astro program related stuff. If you think there is a problem with your subscription, email us or drop by. You can view the mailing list archive <a style="color: #0166d3" href='http://mailman.ucalgary.ca/mailman/private/pasa-l/'>here</a>.
